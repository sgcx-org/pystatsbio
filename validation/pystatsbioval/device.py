"""Capture the environment manifest behind a benchmark run.

One job: record exactly what produced a set of measurements — the library under test
and its version, how it was installed (PyPI vs editable), the interpreter/library
stack, and the compute device — so a frozen artifact is reproducible and a canonical
report can refuse to be built from an unreleased local checkout.

This is the library-neutral vendored copy of the pystatistics ``pystatsval.device``:
the manifest records a generic ``library`` + ``library_version`` pair (defaulting to
``pystatsbio``) rather than a pystatistics-specific key, so the same harness can
validate any ``pystats*`` package.

Two hard rules, both learned from real bugs:

1. The library version is read from the **imported module**
   (``<library>.__version__``), never from ``importlib.metadata``. An editable
   install freezes the metadata version at install time, so metadata can report a
   stale version while the imported code is newer (the documented stale-label bug).

2. ``install_source`` distinguishes ``pypi`` from ``editable``. A *canonical*
   validation report must be built from a PyPI release; :func:`require_pypi`
   enforces that and fails loud otherwise.

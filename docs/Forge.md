## ⚙️ Project Portfolio

Forge supports multiple concurrent ML research projects:

### Active Projects

#### Project Bonsai (Primary)
- **Tagline**: *Pruning neural networks with precision and discipline.*
- **Summary**: Project Bonsai is a principled framework for neural network pruning that emphasizes careful, iterative reduction of network parameters based on statistical sensitivity, rather than blunt heuristic approaches (e.g., magnitude pruning). It embodies the philosophy that pruning should be deliberate and thoughtful—akin to tending a bonsai tree—optimizing models while preserving their structure and function. Bonsai focuses on centralized configuration discipline, reproducibility, and rigorous benchmarking across architectures and datasets.
- **Status**: Active development
- **Key Innovation**: Wilcoxon + FANIM breakthrough approach
- **Data Volume**: ~100GB of sensitivity analysis data

#### Project Rodin
- **Tagline**: *Toward concept space reasoning in language models.*
- **Summary**: Project Rodin explores a novel architecture for language understanding, introducing a latent concept space for AI reasoning. Its core components include: **Polly (the Parrot)** - an autoencoder that maps language to latent concept vectors, and **The Difference Engine** - a transformer operating directly in concept space, enabling manipulation of abstract ideas independent of language syntax. The project aims to move beyond associative prediction toward AI systems that can "think" conceptually and semantically—*sculpting meaning like Rodin sculpted marble.*
- **Status**: Research phase
- **Integration**: Shares Forge infrastructure

#### Project Marin  
- **Tagline**: *AI-native assistant for modern inboxes and workflow.*
- **Summary**: Project Marin is an integrated AI system designed to rethink how users interact with email, documents, and schedules. It enables natural language querying, smart classification (e.g., receipts, spam, urgent communications), and workflow automation (saving attachments, generating summaries, etc.). At its core is a foundation model fine-tuned on personal communications data (e.g., emails), combined with contextual LLM-powered orchestration to replace traditional inbox interfaces.
- **Status**: Development
- **Resources**: Utilizes shared datasets and GPU resources

#### Project LACUNA
- **Tagline**: *LLM-Augmented Classification of UNobserved Assumptions.*
- **Summary**: Project LACUNA addresses a long-standing blind spot in biostatistics: the undocumented, intuitive assumption that missing data are Missing At Random (MAR). LACUNA provides an AI-augmented diagnostic framework that integrates classical statistical tests (e.g., Little's MCAR test), analyzes observed missingness patterns, and leverages large language models to incorporate contextual domain knowledge and study metadata, outputting a structured plausibility assessment of MCAR/MAR/MNAR status. It is *not* an imputer—it's a principled decision-support tool that restores rigor to missingness mechanism assessment, embodying the philosophy that *statistics is the quantification of uncertainty—even where certainty is impossible.*
- **Status**: Research
- **Focus**: Biostatistics and missing data analysis

#### Project Epistrophe
- **Tagline**: *Understanding human motivation.*
- **Summary**: Project Epistrophe is a framework for modeling and interpreting core motivational archetypes, reflecting six irreducible psychological drives: Truth Seeker, Caretaker, Engineer, Founder, Creator, and Spirited Competitor. The project is designed to quantify individuals' archetype "stacks," provide archetype-based recommendations (e.g., games, narratives), and offer a motivational profile orthogonal to personality trait models like the Big Five.
- **Status**: Research
- **Requirements**: Psychology-focused ML workloads

#### Project Simulacrum
- **Tagline**: *AI that emulates the style of human masters.*
- **Summary**: Project Simulacrum is an AI framework for style emulation, initially conceived around chess but extensible to other domains of human performance. Its core idea is to train models not merely to optimize for winning or accuracy but to replicate the style, decision patterns, and "feel" of specific individuals (e.g., famous grandmasters). In its chess incarnation, it uses supervised learning from historical game datasets to produce agents that "play like" Tal, Fischer, or Kasparov—even if their strategies aren't optimal by modern engines' standards.
- **Status**: Experimental
